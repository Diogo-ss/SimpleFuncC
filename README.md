## Simple-Func-For-C

I'm creating simple functions for C. <br />
I'm still learning very early on, so this repository is a way of recording my evolution with C, not a project in itself.

### So far have been created
> 🔴 ```ft_listf.c``` list elements of a string (still incomplete)<br />
> 🔴 ```ft_spacerm.c``` remove spaces from a sentence (still incomplete) <br />

>🔴 Alpha<br />
>🟡 Test<br />
>🟢 Finish<br />
