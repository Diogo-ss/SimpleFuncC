## Simple-Func-For-C

I'm creating simple functions for C. <br />
I'm still learning very early on, so this repository is a way of recording my evolution with C, not a project in itself.

### So far have been created
> ⚪ Include to use functions: ```#include "libft.h"``` <br />

> 🔴 ```ft_listf.c``` List elements of a string (still incomplete) <br />

> 🔴 ```ft_spacerm.c``` Remove spaces from a sentence (still incomplete) <br />

> 🔴 ```ft_swap.c``` Swap A values for B, and B for A. Being divided into three types of swap(still incomplete) <br />
>┖ 🔴```ft_swapd.c``` Swap the integer value of A for the integer value of B, and the integer value of B for the integer value of A.<br />
>┖ 🔴```ft_swapf.c``` Swap the float value of A for the float value of B, and the float value of B for the float value of A.<br />
>┖ ⚫```ft_swapc.c``` Swap the char value of A for the char value of B, and the char value of B for the char value of A.<br />
>┖ ⚫```ft_swaps.c``` Swap the elements of A with the elements of B, and the elements of B with the elements of A.<br />
>Attention: The strings must be the same size. <br />
